# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Notes Graph**: `Deckard: Open Notes Graph` (also available from a graph
  icon beside the Dashboard icon in Related Notes) opens a zoomable
  force-directed map of every indexed note, task, and tag connection, with
  Obsidian-style Filters, Display, and Forces panels, hover neighbor
  highlighting, click-to-select, sidebar-hover graph highlighting, and
  Cmd/Ctrl-click-through to source lines and tag overviews. Tag nodes are
  rendered as separated virtual anchors. Notes and tasks are assigned to
  deterministic visual communities from structural and prevalence-adjusted tag
  evidence, while secondary tags remain lighter cross-community bridges. Notes
  and tasks can be independently hidden from
  the Filters panel. While the graph tab is active, the sidebar lists direct
  connected notes, tasks, and tags using shared sidebar card styles; Markdown
  editors retain the existing Related Notes ranking. The selected-node header
  opens that node's note/task source or tag overview directly. The graph also
  exposes connection density, tag prevalence bias, secondary bridge strength,
  and an all-links comparison toggle for experimenting with the
  prevalence-aware local backbone, plus visual community detection with
  virtual tag anchors, cluster cohesion and community spacing controls, and a
  Reset graph settings button that restores defaults, clears filters, and
  reframes the view.
- Release preparation now derives semantic versions from Conventional Commit
